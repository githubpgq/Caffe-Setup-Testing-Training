Description:

Placed under the folder "images," all the 1980 images in Emotion6 are collected from Flickr.
Each image in Emotion6 is placed under one of the six sub-folders under the folder "images."
There are 330 images under each sub-folder.
The name of the sub-folder is the emotion keyword used to search the images in that sub-folder.

The file "ground_truth.txt" lists the valence, arousal, and emotion distribution of each image in Emotion6.
The ground truth is collected by our user study mentioned in [1].
Each line in "ground_truth.txt" (except the first line) lists the information associated with one image.

The format is as follows:
[image_filename] [valence] [arousal] [prob. anger] [prob. disgust] [prob. fear] [prob. joy] [prob. sadness] [prob. surprise] [prob. neutral]

For example, the second line "disgust/1.jpg	2.5	3.8	0.133333	0.7	0	0.0666667	0.1	0	0" means that for the image placed in "images/disgust/1.jpg," the valence and arousal scores are 2.5 and 3.8 respectively.
The emotion distribution of the image "images/disgust/1.jpg" in terms of the probability of being classified in each emotion category is as follows:
the probability of being classified as anger is 0.133333;
the probability of being classified as disgust is 0.7;
the probability of being classified as fear is 0;
the probability of being classified as joy is 0.0666667;
the probability of being classified as sadness is 0.1;
the probability of being classified as surprise is 0;
the probability of being classified as neutral is 0.
